# Vim - What is it? How does it work? Why is it so hard? 
	- vim is built on vi which was built by Bill Joy in 1976. 
	- either you love it, or you hate it. 
	- I started jrnl as an exercise in using Vim more, so when I work in Vim to write code it comes more naturally. I fish in vim doesn't know it's vimming.  
	- this is a great vim tutorial: https://www.openvim.com/
# Where is my .jrnl file stored? 
	- for every day you use jrnl there will be a YYMMDD.jrnl file created. 
	- the default location is ~/Documents/jrnl/
# How do I change the default location of my .jrnl file storage? 
	1) open jrnl.sh in a text editor. 
	2) edite line XX. 
# How about adding X feature? 
	- little black books full of blank paper are very simple. 
	- uncluttered tools nurture uncluttered thoughts.
	- we're minimalists. 
	- no. 
	- ok, maybe, but probably not.
# Where do I send the praise for this life affirming software tool?
